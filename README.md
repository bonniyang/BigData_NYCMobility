This project presents a comprehensive analysis of New York City's transportation trends between 2016 and 2018, examining shifts in consumer preferences across yellow and green taxis, and Citi Bike. 
By integrating data from NYC taxi records, citibikes data, weather data, and NYC park events data, our analysis aims to achieve several objectives.

• Conduct a thorough examination of New Yorkers' transportation preferences across different modes of transit, spanning the years from 2016 to 2018.

• Identify transportation trends by exploring demands based on weather to understand and assist with supply-and-demand issues.

• Understand how park events and subsequent street closures impact transportation metrics such as transportation mode, fare prices, and quantity of rides taken.

• Conduct a map analysis to identify hotspots for each of the transit modes.

• Create a price prediction model which incorporates user demand, weather conditions, and event occurence.

These analyses will allow urban planners of New York to gain a better understanding of the transporation systems on which the city runs and how to optimize them in order to better serve the people of the city.
