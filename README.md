This project presents a comprehensive analysis of New York City's transportation trends between 2016 and 2018, examining shifts in consumer preferences across yellow and green taxis, and Citi Bike. Utilizing extensive datasets, we researched usage patterns, fare variations, payment methods, and the influence of weather and events on transportation choices. Additionally, a predictive regressions model was also developed to forecast fare prices, providing valuable insights for strategic planning in urban mobility.
